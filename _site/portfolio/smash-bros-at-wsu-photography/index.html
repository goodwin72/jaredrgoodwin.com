        <p>During my freshman year of college, I helped start <strong>Smash Bros at WSU</strong>, a student organization at Washington State University that hosts weekly events and monthly tournaments for games in the <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> series. For several years, one of my jobs within the club was event photography.</p>

<p>At one of the first events I attended, I asked if I could try photographing it - as someone who pursued photography as one of their primary hobbies in high school, I was interested in getting more photography experience, and figured it could be of use to the then-unofficial club.</p>

<p>Posting photos from every event on Facebook ended up generating <em>far</em> more publicity than anyone in the clubâ€™s committee had expected, and when I joined the committee a few months later, I took up photography as one of my jobs. For 2 years, I consistently photographed our monthly events, selected and edited the best of the shots, and uploaded all of the final versions to social media.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2016, my management focus readjusted to other parts of the club. I moved to occasionally photographing events, focusing on events that had special weight to them (such as our regional tournament at the beginning of 2017).</p>

<p>Here are several of my favorite photos from those events:</p>
