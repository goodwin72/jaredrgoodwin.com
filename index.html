header-description: 
    - Hi! I’m a webdev with a love for designs that are simultaneously clean, enticing, and considerate of their audience’s needs and wants. 

    - I also occasionally design social media graphics and handle event photography.

    - In my free time, I’m passionate about music and video games, and was previously involved in the competitive Super Smash Bros. scene as a tournament organizer.
