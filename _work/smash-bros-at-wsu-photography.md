During my freshman year of college, I helped start **Smash Bros at WSU**, a student organization at Washington State University that hosts weekly events and monthly tournaments for games in the *Super Smash Bros.* series. For several years, one of my jobs within the club was event photography.

At one of the first events I attended, I asked if I could try photographing it - as someone who pursued photography as one of their primary hobbies in high school, I was interested in getting more photography experience, and figured it could be of use to the then-unofficial club. 

Posting photos from every event on Facebook ended up generating *far* more publicity than anyone in the club's committee had expected, and when I joined the committee a few months later, I took up photography as one of my jobs. For 2 years, I consistently photographed our monthly events, selected and edited the best of the shots, and uploaded all of the final versions to social media. 

At the beginning of 2016, my management focus readjusted to other parts of the club. I moved to occasionally photographing events, focusing on events that had special weight to them (such as our regional tournament at the beginning of 2017).

Here are several of my favorite photos from those events:
